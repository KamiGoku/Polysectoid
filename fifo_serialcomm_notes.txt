RingBuf + Serial Transmission:

- Use Timer ISR to sample data and send it to UART -- send_packet() like in Sender.ino

- Another ISR is used for the receiver part -- the TM4C123 had a UART ISR which (probably?) 
just triggered whenever the UART got new data, but I think in our case just Serial.available()
is like the same thing.

- The "UART ISR" (however it gets implemented) will read the packets it received à la Receiver.ino,
and then put it in the FIFO.

- The main "loop()" should then go on to use the data in the FIFO. There should either be an appropriate
delay before it does so, or it could just spin on the FIFO's empty condition.
